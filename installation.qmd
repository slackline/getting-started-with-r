[R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) are two separate programmes that need
installing.

## Git

In the long term it would be worth getting familiar with Git and GitHub and there is an excellent site that guides you
through doing that [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/), this site won't attempt to duplicate
the content so please work through the site to get yourself setup with Git and GitHub.

## R

[Download](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and install R for your operating system.

## RStudio

[RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) produced by the company Posit that
makes using R a bit smoother. It should be straight-forward to download and install following the instructions on the
linked website.


When you start RStudio the window has several different sections as shown below

There are panes within the window and each pane has tabs for different tasks/jobs. Your layout may be slightly different
but will have the same areas as the above image, which in the bottom right thereis a "Files"
tab showing with other tabs for "Plots", "Packages", "Help", "Viewer" and "Presentation". On the top left is the
"Console" with tabs for "Terminal and "Background jobs". On the left are tabs for "Environment", "History" and
"Connections".


### Starting an R Project

Projects are a way of encapsulating a group of files and work in a single managed space.

Start RStudio and select _File > New Project_ in the window that appears select _New Directory > New Project_.

work to be saved to. Tick the boxes _Create a git repository_ and _Use renv with this project_ then click the _Create
Project_ button.

You've just initialised the directory to be an R Project that RStudio recognises.
