title: "Getting Started with R"
---

This is a website written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org), it interweaves [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with
[R](https://www.r-project.org) code. Its very similar to RMarkdown for which I've included a number of links.

To get started with R you need to install two programms [R](https://www.r-project.org) and
[RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/). In the long term it would be worth getting familiar with Git and GitHub and
there is an excellent site that guides you through doing that [Happy Git and GitHub for the
useR](https://happygitwithr.com/), but for now just install R and RStudio.

Once you've installed RStudio start the programme.
