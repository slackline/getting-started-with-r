Its brilliant and shows how to structure workflows, organise files, read data from different sources, join different datasets, handle missing data, make summaries in tables and graphs. There is the R4DS Online Learning Community which has a Slack community with multiple channels where you can ask for questions you have as you work through the book."

R is no exception, there are over 20000 packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\nThere is a suite/group of packages collectively called the Tidyverse that follow a consistent design philosophy and grammar that make writing and using R much easier. These are worth using but need installing and are explained well in the R for Data Science (2e) book detailed below.\nYou can easily install them from the Console with.\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nOnce installed you need to load the packages into R and so in RStudio you would type in the Console\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nAll the packages and programmes are now available to use."

However, long term you want to have code that is reproducible so its better to write your commands in a file and execute them from there.\nOne of the panels in RStudio has a tab labelled Files and from here you can create new folders and files. Using the New Folder button create a director called r, double-click on it to enter that directory and then use the New Blank File and select R Script to create a file called my_first_script.R. This opens up the file and you can start typing in it."
